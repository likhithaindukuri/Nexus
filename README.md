# Project Overview

Nexus is a **Multi-Tenant AI Knowledge Platform** that enables organizations to build their own AI-powered knowledge assistants without writing any AI code.

Instead of manually searching through hundreds of pages of PDFs, users can simply ask questions in natural language and receive accurate answers generated using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with document citations.

Every organization gets:

- Secure Workspace
- Document Management
- AI Knowledge Base
- Embeddable Chatbot Widget
- Analytics Dashboard
- Organization Isolation
- Source-aware AI Responses

Organizations only need to upload their documents. Nexus takes care of processing, indexing, semantic search, and AI-powered response generation.

---

# Why Nexus?

Organizations store thousands of pages of important information inside documents such as:

- Admission Guidelines
- Employee Handbooks
- Policies
- Insurance Documents
- Medical Manuals
- FAQs
- SOPs
- User Guides

Searching these documents manually is slow and frustrating.

Nexus transforms those documents into an AI-powered assistant that can instantly answer questions using only the organization's uploaded knowledge.

Instead of searching documents manually...

# RAG Pipeline

The chatbot uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer questions based only on the organization's uploaded documents.

```
User Question

        │

        ▼

Generate Question Embedding

        │

        ▼

Search ChromaDB

        │

        ▼

Retrieve Top Relevant Chunks

        │

        ▼

Pass Context + Question to Gemini

        │

        ▼

Generate Final Response

        │

        ▼

Return Answer with Citation
```

Unlike traditional chatbots, Nexus does **not rely solely on the language model's memory**. Instead, it retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the organization's knowledge base before generating an answer. This improves accuracy and helps reduce hallucinations while providing source-aware responses.

---

# Database Design

## PostgreSQL

Stores structured application data such as:

- Organizations
- Users
- Uploaded Documents
- Widget Configuration
- Analytics
- Authentication Information

---

## ChromaDB

Stores semantic vector embeddings for:

- Document Chunks
- Metadata
- Similarity Search

Each uploaded document is converted into embeddings that allow semantic retrieval during chat.

# Challenges Faced

Building Nexus involved solving several real-world engineering challenges beyond implementing a typical CRUD application.

## Designing a Multi-Tenant Architecture

Every organization should only have access to its own:

- Documents
- Chatbot
- Analytics
- Widget Configuration
- Conversations

Implementing complete organization-level data isolation across the application was one of the most important architectural decisions.

---

## Building an End-to-End RAG Pipeline

Creating an accurate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline required multiple processing stages:

- PDF Text Extraction
- Document Chunking
- Embedding Generation
- Semantic Vector Search
- Context Retrieval
- AI Response Generation

Ensuring each stage worked together efficiently while maintaining response quality required careful design and testing.

---

## Developing an Embeddable AI Widget

The chatbot needed to work on any website with only a single JavaScript snippet.

This involved:

- Widget Token Authentication
- Secure Communication
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Responsive UI
- Dynamic Configuration

---

## Working with Vector Databases

Unlike traditional SQL databases, vector databases store semantic representations of text.

Learning how embeddings work and implementing semantic similarity search using ChromaDB was one of the most valuable parts of this project.

---

## Deploying a Full-Stack AI Application

Deploying an AI application introduced additional considerations such as:

- Environment Variable Management
- API Key Security
- Database Connectivity
- CORS Configuration
- Frontend & Backend Integration
- Production Deployment

---

# Why This Project?

Traditional document search requires users to manually browse through lengthy documents to locate information.

Nexus simplifies this process by transforming organizational knowledge into an AI-powered assistant capable of answering questions instantly with transparent citations.

Instead of searching through documents...

```

User

↓

Search PDF

↓

Read Pages

↓

Find Answer

```

Users simply ask:

> "What is the hostel fee?"

and Nexus retrieves the most relevant document sections before generating a reliable answer.
